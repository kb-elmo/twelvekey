# Twelvekey case

### These files are meant for 3D printing only! 

They are not suitable for CNC machining and trying to use them for that will most likely result in failure of the parts.

The top piece should be printed upside down with supports for the integrated plate to get the best looking results.  
The bottom can be printed without any supports in it's natural orientation.

The bottom part is a simple friction fit into the top.  
Make sure that everything works and is installed properly on the PCB when putting the case together.  
Removing the bottom piece later is not really easy.
